AI-powered mindfulness and meditation apps can provide personalized recommendations for exercises based on a user's individual needs and preferences. These apps can track progress and adapt their recommendations over time, providing users with tailored support.

Real-Time Feedback
------------------

AI-powered mindfulness and meditation apps can also provide real-time feedback to users, helping them understand their progress and make adjustments as needed. This feedback can include suggestions for improving posture, breathing, and focus.

Guided Meditations
