Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on changing negative thoughts and behaviors to improve mental health. Recently, AI technology has been used to support CBT interventions. This chapter will explore the applications of AI in CBT.

Thought Restructuring
---------------------

AI algorithms can help individuals identify negative or maladaptive thoughts and reframe them positively. For example, an AI-powered tool may ask users to write down their negative thoughts, then use machine learning to suggest more positive ways to think about the situation.

Problem-Solving
---------------

AI-powered tools can provide personalized problem-solving exercises and recommendations to help individuals develop coping skills and improve cognitive flexibility. Users can input information about a problem they are facing, and the tool can provide personalized recommendations based on evidence-based research.

Goal-Setting
------------

AI can assist individuals in setting realistic goals and tracking progress towards achieving them. The tool may recommend specific goals based on user input and track progress over time, providing personalized feedback and motivation.

Overall, AI technology has the potential to enhance CBT interventions and support mental health in powerful ways. By using AI-powered tools to support thought restructuring, problem-solving, and goal-setting, individuals can develop cognitive resilience and improve their overall well-being.
